# E-Fashion-Store
The scope of the E-Fashion Website includes the development of a web-based 
application accessible on desktop and mobile devices. The Website will allow 
users to create accounts, browse products, search for specific items, add 
products to the shopping cart, proceed to secure checkout, track order status, 
and receive email notifications for order updates. It will also provide 
administrators with user management, inventory management, and sales 
reporting functionalities.
